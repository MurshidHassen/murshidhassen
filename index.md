### [](#header-3) We finally met
 Greetings üôà, I am Murshid Hassen, Engineering undergrad from Sri Lanka (The pearl of the Indian ocean üòç).
You could find me @murshidhassen throughout the web. I like software, it's soft. (credits to Brenna O'Brien (@brnnbrn))
Part of me loves graphics programming that's why I created my own simple opensource gaming startup. Using all my free time I have been able to build one simple game and I love it. My Primary focus is to learn and build great products to humanity so that one day we could land on the Earth we have imagined üöÄ
Most importantly I like the part Opensource software and what FSF community and other FOSS communities have done for years...
